## Conceptual Aerospace Systems Design

The aim of this module was to design an Earth obseervation CubeSat platform capable of monitoring agricultrual land usage
through the identification of the vegetation index at a landsacpe field of regard.

My role was that of the 'Mission' engineer and as such I was responsible for launch/orbit calculations. The notebooks in this
repository detail some of the work done in this analysis, using Python to calculate various parameters.

Note that the use of code was not required in this module, however in order to produce orbital decay calculations I believed it to be necessary. The use of Python as a tool for calculations and simulations is something that I havee come to appreciate and this work has helped improve my knowledge.
